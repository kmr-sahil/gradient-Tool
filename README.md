# kolor-tool

The website kolor-tool.vercel.app is a designer tool that allows users to generate light theme colors from the given input color, compare shades of colors, and find complementary colors. The main usecase and reason for this tool to be needed is that when deciding color for different states of buttons, we usually tend to lower the opacity, but according to best UI/UX practices, this is wrong; instead, we should just increase the luminosity or brightness of that color. Although there can be many use cases, I am keeping on improving and adding more amazing features to this tool.
